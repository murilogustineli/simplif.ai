## Capstone Project
Congratulations on making it through the first eight weeks! Now you‚Äôre ready to build a cool project!

We are providing the following guideline for the capstone project.
- Use Azure Cognitive Services to solve a problem of your choice. It will show how easy it is to build an AI solution using Cognitive Services.
- You have learned the basic understanding/intuition of machine learning throughout the training and is now ready to build an AI solution. Should be comfortable working with APIs based on your use-case (_e.g., [Python SKD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples/)_).

We encourage you to keep in mind the following **three rules** when approaching the capstone project:
1. Use Azure Cognitive Services (Language or Vision).
2. Define your use-case. Your use-case is what you‚Äôll be creating including the dataset you‚Äôll be using (deadline by week 8).
3. Try to create something unique that hasn‚Äôt been done before. We could possibly apply for a patent!


### Onboarding on Azure
You will be using the **NAIP Azure subscription (DI_NA_DataAI_Workshops_001)** to follow the training exercises and create your capstone project. You should have access to the NAIP Azure subscription. If you don‚Äôt have access, please reach out one of the Simplif.ai coordinators.

In the NAIP Azure account, you will find a **resource group** made specially for you to use. Your resource group name will be a combination of:
- The first letter of your first name followed by your last name.
- E.g., **Tony Stark** resource group is ***tstartk***.

You may find your resource group [**here**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups). Make sure you're using the NAIP subscription.


### Goals of the capstone project
- For the capstone project, your goal is to use what you learned throughout the first 8 weeks to create a unique solution that hasn‚Äôt been done before using AI.
- You have up to **week 8** (_September 5th_) to come up with your use-case.
- We will hold weekly office hours to answer questions you may have and guide you throughout your project.


### Possible steps you may want to consider
1. Think about a use case or a problem you want to solve. Hopefully, something that hasn‚Äôt been done before.
2. Find/create a dataset that can be used to train an AI system to solve the problem. Check it out some datasets here.
3. Incorporate Azure Cognitive Services into training/deploying your model.
4. Reiterate and try to improve your model.


### Potential project ideas
- Create a computer vision system that recognizes your pets.
- Create a resume parser using NLP.
- Create a model that recognizes anomalies on images (_e.g., X-ray images_).
- Create a music recommendation system.
- Create an NLP system that understands movie reviews as positive or negative.

Don‚Äôt worry if these ideas sound too daunting or difficult. By **week 8** (_September 5th_), you should be able to know at least where to start. Also, we will be providing feedback and mentoring during the Capstone project. However, it is expected that you come up with your own use case.

Here‚Äôs some advice. Try to create the simplest model you can by the end of the first week of the capstone project phase and use the following weeks to iterate and improve your model. It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of trying to create something very complex and forget that a working model is better than no model at all.

Happy learning üòä
